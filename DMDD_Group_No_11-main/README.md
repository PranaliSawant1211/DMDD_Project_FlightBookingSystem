The system is designed to efficiently and safely keep track of flight booking records, maintain a centralized database, and enable authorized users to access and manage booking details. The system includes multiple entities, such as Airport, Passenger, Flight_Details, Flight_Service, Seat_Details, Flight_Cost, Reservation, Travel_Class, Calendar, Payment, Payment_Status, and Service_Offering. These entities are linked by various relationships, such as a flight being associated with an airport, a reservation being linked to a passenger, and a payment status being associated with a payment. 
In addition to designing the Flight Booking System database, we also utilized Tableau to visualize the data and create insightful dashboards. We created multiple dashboards to analyze various aspects of the flight bookings, such as the busiest airports by city, the most opted travel class, and the revenue generated by each travel class. These dashboards provided a comprehensive view of the flight bookings data, enabling airlines to make informed decisions and optimize their services for better revenue and customer satisfaction.
